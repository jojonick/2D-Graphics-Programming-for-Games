3.1. Research a classic arcade system or game console (released prior to 2000). What was the maximum texture size? By including the system’s color depth, 
calculate the amount of memory required to store the maximum-size texture for that system.

Ans:
PlayStation. According to spec, 256x256 is the maximum sprite size (texture?) and the maximum color depth is of 16,777,216 colors (24-bit true color) so 
to store the maximum-size texture for that system we need of 256 x 256 x 3 byte of memory (196608 byte).
